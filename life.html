          <h2>Mental Models and Making Decisions You Don’t Regret</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="post-body">
          <p>
            What makes a good decision? When I ask people that question, I often
            get answers like: “When the outcome is successful.” Why is it that
            we, as a society, romanticize outcomes? Only things and people that
            succeed are celebrated. Just look at all the articles and books that
            idolize successful people. And to a degree, that’s obvious. But it’s
            also misleading. We tend to overlook cases that did not come with a
            successful outcome. And when we do look at failure, we are often
            quick to explain why things failed. In hindsight, we can all look at
            mistakes and say that it was imminent. But if preventing mistakes is
            that easy, why are we still make decisions that we regret? Take the
            case of the Titanic. Looking back, we all know that the luxury liner
            that traveled from Southampton to New York made many costly
            mistakes. For example, it is well known that the Titanic didn’t
            carry enough lifeboats. “What happens when all the lifeboats are
            used in case of an emergency?” is something that someone surely
            said, right? We just don’t know! We weren’t there. How about another
            interesting fact? The Titanic was tested for 6 hours and never with
            a full crew. After that, they loaded up the passengers and set sail
            towards New York. “Shouldn’t we try this thing out more before we
            bring passengers on board?” someone surely said. I guess not. But
            here’s the thing. No one wanted the Titanic disaster to happen. And
            no one predicted it…Until after the fact. A few decades before all
            those innocent people died, Fyodor Dostoevsky famously said:
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>Bad Decisions and Good Decisions</h4>
          <br />
          <p>
            It’s easy to look at success and attribute it to good decision
            making. But here’s the thing—that statement is also true the other
            way around. Failure is not always explained by bad decision making.
            However, that’s what most historians do. But like Dostoevsky said,
            in hindsight failure is always obvious. The people who were
            responsible for the Titanic probably thought they were making the
            right decisions at the time. After the fact, they probably regretted
            many things. But I don’t think good or bad decisions have anything
            to do with the outcome. Peter Bevelin, the author of Seeking Wisdom,
            puts it well: “Good decisions can lead to bad outcomes and vice
            versa.” The truth is: You can’t predict the future. Sometimes even
            bad decisions can lead to good outcomes. So that’s why I think it’s
            pointless when people pretend they can teach you how to make “good”
            decisions. There’s no such thing. Any person who’s failed a lot in
            life will tell you that.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>Mental Models: Focus On The Process, Not The Outcome</h4>
          <br />
          <p>
            The way you look at how something works in the real world is called
            a mental model. It’s your thinking framework about something. But
            when we make decisions, we often don’t think about our framework and
            immediately jump to a discussion about potential outcomes. We ask,
            “What will happen if we make this decision?” That’s an
            incomprehensive method because you’re not questioning your
            decision-making process. You’re only looking at the outcome. But
            have you considered what specific thinking frameworks (mental
            models) you can use for your decision? Too often, we skip the
            process and jump right to deciding. Maybe that’s due to a lack of
            time, resources, or knowledge— it doesn’t matter. Whatever your
            reason is, it’s never an excuse to skip the decision-making process
            altogether. Because that’s the only way to become a bad decision
            maker— regardless of the outcome. So instead of focusing on how
            successful your choices are, focus on how comprehensive your
            decision-making process is. Look, you don’t have to know everything
            about mental models—I certainly don’t. Most pseudo-intellectuals
            spend more time talking about what a mental model is instead of
            using them to achieve anything meaningful in life. They just like to
            define mental models. But as you and I both know, knowledge without
            application is useless. That’s why I recommend reading only the
            following two books that focus on this topic:
          </p>
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a href="#">Seeking Wisdom by Peter Bevelin</a>—Discusses the
              mental models of Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett.
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="#">Fooled By Randomness by Nassim Taleb</a>—One of my
              favorite mental models. It helps with understanding how random
              events influence outcomes.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We can never predict the future, nor can we know all mental models
            that exist. But we can make decisions we don’t regret. By simply
            focusing on the thinking process, we can always say we did the right
            thing. And that’s the only sure way to avoid regret—no matter what
            the outcome is.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>“What’s the right thing?”</h4>
          <br />
          <p>
            It’s clear we should never regret making mistakes. Every mistake is
            a lesson after all. However, there’s another type of regret that
            literally kills people. It’s the regret of inaction. I’ve seen this
            up close with my grandmother. At the end of her life, she drowned in
            her own sorrow. And that sorrow was solely made up of regret about
            the things she never did. Look, no matter what you do, we all suffer
            in life. But there’s a difference in suffering, as Jim Rohn once
            said: “We must all suffer one of two things: the pain of discipline
            or the pain of regret or disappointment.” Achieving your goals.
            Improving yourself and your relationships. Writing a book. Building
            a business. It’s painful. It takes a lot of time, energy, and
            sacrifice to achieve things that are worthwhile in life. But you
            know what’s also painful? The regret of inaction, disappointment,
            and laziness. Which type of suffering hurts more? It’s up to you to
            decide.

          <h2>Want To Make Better Decisions? Do This</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="post-body">
          <p>
            Do you ever look back on your decisions and think, “Why I on earth
            did I do that?”
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>We all make bad decisions.</p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>Buying an SUV that sucks up all your cash</li>
            <br />
            <li>Starting a relationship without being in love</li>
            <br />
            <li>Saying yes to a job that you’re not passionate about</li>
            <br />
            <li>Creating products that no one needs</li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <p>
            Shit happens (the above examples are all about me). But the funny
            thing is that bad decisions never seem like bad decisions at the
            moment.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I’ve been reading about the decision-making process of Warren Buffet
            and Charlie Munger, two of the most successful investors of all
            time.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In Alice Schroeder’s biography of Warren Buffett, I read that Buffet
            and Munger have a learning strategy that’s based on what you should
            avoid doing. They identify mistakes and do their best to avoid those
            mistakes. But as Charlie Munger says:
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>“Smart people do dumb things.”</p>
          <br />
          <p>
            You can never avoid making a mistake. However, you can do your best
            to avoid making dumb decisions.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Plus, by learning from other people’s mistakes, you can make their
            mistakes your own. You’ll learn faster that way.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <h4>Don’t Overthink.</h4>
          <br />
          <br />
          <p>
            Smart people are way too preoccupied with doing the right things.
            They want to have a perfect life, career, house, business, car,
            holiday, etc.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            When you put too much pressure on yourself to make the right
            decisions, you get analysis paralysis.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I recently spoke to a friend who wanted to make a career move. I
            asked him to walk me through his thinking process:
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <i
            >“I like the company I work for, but my job isn’t engaging anymore.
            I’ve been doing this work for four years. And sure, I’ve been
            promoted twice, but it’s still the same work. So I’ve been looking
            at other companies. But what if I go somewhere else and that doesn’t
            work out? I’ll have to move on quick. And that won’t look good on my
            resume.”</i
          >
          <br />
          <br />
          <p>I remained silent.</p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <i
            >“Just hearing myself talk leads me to another thing: Overthinking
            it.”</i
          >
          <br />
          <br />
          <p>
            We both laughed our asses off. I can do the same with overthinking.
            And I bet you’ve been there too.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            When you overanalyze every single decision, you become paralyzed.
            Result? Nothing. Now, that’s a bad outcome!
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>That’s how people end up wasting their lives.</p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The only way you can stop overthinking is by making yourself aware
            of your thinking process. When I asked my friend about his thinking,
            he became aware of how irrational his process was.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>You can’t control the future. So stop thinking about it.</p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <h4>Do This Instead: Make Small Decisions. Decide Often.</h4>
          <br />
          <br />
          <p>
            When you make small decisions early, before they become big — it’s
            easy. When you put off decisions, they become big — and painful.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The longer you stay in a bad relationship, the harder it gets to
            leave. It’s also true for your job.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <h4>Earlier Decisions Lead To Better Decisions</h4>
          <br />
          <br />
          <p>
            The earlier and more you decide, the more chance that you make
            <i> better</i> decisions.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I often say that there are no right or wrong decisions — only
            <i> decisions</i>. That’s not entirely accurate. Of course, there’s
            a difference in the quality of our choices. That’s the topic of
            another article.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            But here’s the thing: NOT making a decision is also a decision. If
            that’s a conscious move, that’s okay. You think about something, and
            you decide that doing nothing is the best option.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            However, I’m referring to not making a decision as in “I’ll put it
            off until another time.”
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            No matter what, you’re making decisions all the time. Instead of
            making fewer conscious decisions, we need to make them
            <i> earlier</i>.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Because all you need are a few good choices in your lifetime anyway.
